===MACRO STEPS===
=================
GENERATION/PREPARATION PHASE 1
1) Generate heightmaps
2) Choose sea level and tundra line
3) Determine prevailing wind direction
4) Generate rainfall and temperature maps based on height, latitude, and rain shadow
5) Generate hot spring locations

EROSION PHASE 1
1) Perform global thermal erosion

GENERATION/PREPARATION PHASE 2
1) Generate ice caps
2) Generate oceans

EROSION PHASE 2
1) Settle submerged sediment to bottom of oceans
2) Perform tidal erosion around coastline
3) Begin populating and iterating a water heightmap
	a) Melt ice caps annually, corresponding to the hot season
	b) Generate random rainfall
	c) Generate liquid at springs

====================
=GENERATION PHASE 1=
====================
Several "maps" will be generated during this phase, which are basically 2-dimensional arrays of scalars

---------------------
Generating Heightmaps
---------------------
Done using the midpoint displacement algorithm.  The results are normalized to a standard range, which will be used as a reference in all the following computations.

----------------------------------
Choosing Levels and Wind Direction
----------------------------------
Wind direction is chosen randomly.

Sea level should be chosen either as a function of what percentage of the map is to be underwater, or as a function of where in the heighmap the seas will originate.

The tundra level should be chosen as either a randomly computed value above sea level (a flag value with some random variation) or as a function of what percentage of the map should eventually contain ice caps.

------------------------
Generating Rainfall Maps
------------------------
Wind and elevation will be the primary factors in this step.  Rainfall is heavier in areas closer to large bodies of water, and where prevailing winds carry moisture to higher, cooler altitudes.  Rainfall will be lighter on the sides of mountain ranges in the direction of prevailing winds, due to rain shadow.  These factors will determine scalar values which slightly modify a region's change of receiving rainfall.

---------------------------
Generating Temperature Maps
---------------------------
Temperature maps, during worldgen, are far less important than rainmaps.  The only thing of importance here is the freezing line, which indicates where ice caps will form during the winter seasons (if there are any locations with high enough elevation).

-------------------------------
Generating Hot Spring Locations
-------------------------------
While most springs will originate from the ocean, it's possible that inland lakes or ice floes will result in seasonal springs.

=================
=EROSION PHASE 1=
=================
The amount of thermal erosion applied to an area is a simple and powerful tool that could be used to generate a variety of landscapes.  Thermal erosion is basically a differential of an element in our heightmap and its neighbors.  The time passing in the simulation is directly proportional to the volume displaced.  The effect of this on the landscape is somewhat normalizing, so it may be unnecessary to include it.  However, it warrants testing to see what visible effects it produces.

====================
=GENERATION PHASE 2=
====================

-------------------
Generating Ice Caps
-------------------
Ice will form and melt above the freezing line as a sinusoid with a period of one year.  For this step, flag any tile above the freezing line as a potential ice cap.  Any precipitation that falls here during the trough of the sinusoid will freeze, and any precipitation that has frozen will melt during the peak of the sinusoid.

-----------------
Generating Oceans
-----------------
Regions below sea level will be mapped, and closed regions (those not bordering the edge of the map) ignored.  Any remaining regions will be randomly assigned as either a sea or a dry basin below sea level.

=================
=EROSION PHASE 2=
=================

---------------------------
Settling submerged sediment
---------------------------
Any portion of the sedimentary heightmap which is below sea level will "slide" until it is level with its neighbors.

-------------
Tidal Erosion
-------------
Sea level should be simulated to rise and fall, taking rock and sediment with it as it falls.

-------------------
Water Heightmapping
-------------------
Rainfall will be affected by the seasonal sinusoid much like the ice cap melting and formation.  An additional heightmap above the terrain layers will be created for water, which will be randomly seeded according to season, taking the rainfall map into account.

The rain map will be iterated over some period of time, attempting to normalize the heights of tiles that contain water with their neighbors.  First, sediment will be shifted to account for difference in volume, then water will move to normalize.  After a certain number of iterations, rain generation will cease and the system will be allowed to reach steady-state.  During this phase, any activity below sea level will be largely ignored.
