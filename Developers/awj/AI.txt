TODO: Talk about factions.

Example: Dwarf Deer
-Eats flora
-Roams randomly from place to place
-Flees from anything not part of its faction

AI Behaviors:
1) Danger present?
    -Yes - Flee
2) Flora present?
    -Yes - Eat
    -No  - Roam

Discussion:
It seems like decision trees would be a good choice; the question is, can we find a way to build decision trees using modules?  We should be able to build decision trees using module inclusion and invocation of specially named behaviors.  For the deer example:

# BEGIN RUBY CODE =============
module FleeFromDanger() ... end
module Graze() ... end
module Roam() ... end

# Depending on how we want to define the behavior, this would change.  I'm going to assume it's either a Proc or a method, like so:
def behavior(state)
    unless flee_from_danger(state)
        unless graze(state)
            roam(state)
        end
    end
end
# END RUBY CODE ===============
