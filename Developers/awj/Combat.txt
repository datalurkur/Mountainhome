ASPECTS OF DWARVEN COMBAT 
=========================

WEAPONS
-------
Damage:
	-Have a damage range [min,max] that dictates damage output (RNG)
    -Affected by wielder's strength
        (TODO: Discuss how this will work)
        (TODO: Discuss how this works with ranged weapons - does a crossbow have a strength applied to the damage of its bolts?)
    -Has a type: normal, piercing, or corrosive
        -Piercing damage ignores the DB statistic of armor
        -Corrosive damage ignores the DR statistic of armor

Attack:
    -Have a chance to miss (RNG)
    -Can target specific body parts
        (TODO: Discuss whether a miss results in a chance to hit a different part)
    -Affected by wielder's skill
        -Tactics skills govern what parts of the body are targeted, whether armor is taken into account, etc
            (TODO: Discuss what exactly this means - intelligence, skill as a combatant in general, etc)
        -Weapon skills affect the ability to hit the chosen part


ARMOR
-----
Damage reduction:
    -Damage blocking stops <x> points of damage from penetrating the armor (used to model things like stones plinking off plate)
        (Naturally, this type of damage reduction is vulnerable to piercing attacks like crossbow bolts and arrows)
    -Damage resistance reduces by a percentage the damage dealt, taking on that damage itself (used to model a werewolf claw ripping a piece of leather armor rather than the flesh of a dwarf)
        (This type of damage reduction is vulnerable to corrosive attacks like acid or lava)

Integrity:
    -Has hitpoints used to model its structural integrity (once so many links break in a chainmail vest, it falls apart)
        (TODO: Discuss whether an armor's integrity affects its damage reduction - ie does really torn-up leather protect less than fresh leather?)
    -Partially damaged armor can be repaired
    -Completely destroyed armor cannot be repaired, but its pieces can be salvages (metal bits from plate can be melted down, scraps of leather can be recycled)


BODY PARTS
----------
Note: Rather than modeling critical hits, it makes more sense to model specific vulnerable locations that act like criticals (extra damage, status effects, etc)

Vulnerabilities:
    -Certain body parts are vulnerable to attack, such as the head and groin
    -These body parts will take damage differently than other parts

Systems:
    -Certain body parts, when damaged, have an effect on the way creatures perform tasks
        -Dwarves that have been hit over the head might make poor decision
        -Goblins with their eyes gouged out are not very good at swinging swords
        -Land squid with their tentacles mangled by a dwarven warhammer are not very good at moving
