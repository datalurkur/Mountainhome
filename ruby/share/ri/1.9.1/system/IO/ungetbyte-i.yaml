- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Pushes back bytes (passed as a parameter) onto <em>ios</em>, such that a subsequent buffered read will return it. Only one byte may be pushed back before a subsequent read operation (that is, you will be able to read only the last of several bytes that have been pushed back). Has no effect with unbuffered reads (such as <tt>IO#sysread</tt>).
