- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Reads the next ``line'' from the I/O stream; lines are separated by <em>sep</em>. A separator of <tt>nil</tt> reads the entire contents, and a zero-length separator reads the input a paragraph at a time (two successive newlines in the input separate paragraphs). The stream must be opened for reading or an <tt>IOError</tt> will be raised. The line read in will be returned and also assigned to <tt>$_</tt>. Returns <tt>nil</tt> if called at end of file. If the first argument is an integer, or optional second argument is given, the returning string would not be longer than the given value in bytes.
