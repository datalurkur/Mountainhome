  :body: "Use to slurp a CSV file into an Array of Arrays. Pass the <tt>path</tt> to the file and any <tt>options</tt> CSV::new() understands. This method also understands an additional <tt>:encoding</tt> parameter that you can use to specify the Encoding of the data in the file to be read. You must provide this unless your data is in Encoding::default_external(). CSV will use this to deterime how to parse the data. You may provide a second Encoding to have the data transcoded as it is read. For example, <tt>encoding: &quot;UTF-32BE:UTF-8&quot;</tt> would read UTF-32BE data from the file but transcode it to UTF-8 before CSV parses it."
