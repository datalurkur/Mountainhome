  :body: Class <tt>Socket</tt> provides access to the underlying operating system socket implementations. It can be used to provide more operating system specific functionality than the protocol-specific socket classes but at the expense of greater complexity. In particular, the class handles addresses using <tt>struct</tt> sockaddr structures packed into Ruby strings, which can be a joy to manipulate.

- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Ruby's implementation of <tt>Socket</tt> causes an exception to be raised based on the error generated by the system dependent implementation. This is why the methods are documented in a way that isolate Unix-based system exceptions from Windows based exceptions. If more information on particular exception is needed please refer to the Unix manual pages or the Windows WinSock reference.
